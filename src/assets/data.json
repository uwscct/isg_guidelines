Additionally, it can be advantageous to use the latest XR technology available when looking to improve the user experience in terms of their immersion and presence whilst learning (Shahu, Kinzer & Michahelles, 2023). Visual cues, such as lighting and depth techniques, should be integrated to encourage users to explore virtual objects and environments, enhancing immersion and interaction (Chakravorty and Rowe, 2018).

          "descriptor": "The game design should consider the ability of differing users to allow it to allow for it to be as inclusive as possible (Desurvire & Kreminski, 2018). Consideration should also be given to ethnic representation within the game (Ariffin, Ahmad, & Sulaiman, 2015), as it can promote cultural understanding and respect for users of the game. Lastly, the game should be accessible to users in their native language as it supports equality by providing equal access, and inclusivity by respecting and acknowledging the diversity of languages among users.",

Furthermore, the game pacing and difficulty should be balanced based on the user performance (Zaki, Wook & Ahmad, 2017; Valenza, Gasparini & Hounsell, 2019; King, 2021), as this aids in mitigating user frustration while enhancing their learning (King, 2021).",
