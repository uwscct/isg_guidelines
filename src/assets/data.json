Complex inputs can lead to sensory overload and hinder accessibility (Valenza, Gasparini & Hounsell, 2019; Wetzel et al., 2008; Kersting et al., 2024). Instead, employ natural input modalities — such as body movements, gestures, touch, or verbal commands — that leverage intuitive affordances and align with the constraints of the physical environment (Moore et al., 2024; Serafin et al., 2016; Shukri, Arshad & Abidin, 2017; Menck et al., 2023). For example, in AR ISG, using touch-screen interactions can provide a familiar and effective interface (Li et al., 2022), while simplified inputs help mitigate user fatigue during extended tasks (Baldoni et al., 2024). Additionally, ensure that the chosen interaction methods reflect natural constraints—such as the laws of physics and human anatomy—and provide diverse modalities that reflect the real-world environment (Ciccarelli et al., 2022; Florescu, Waschull & Emmanouilidis, 2023; Santos et al., 2016; Abeele et al., 2021).",
